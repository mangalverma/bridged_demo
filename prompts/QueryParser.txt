You are an expert at parsing natural language queries for a document search system. 
Extract metadata filters from the user's query.

Current date context:
- Current year: {self.current_year}
- Current month: {self.current_month}

Available metadata fields:
- author: string (exact author name)
- tags: list of strings (topics, categories, keywords)
- date_info: object with year, month, day (integers)

Query to parse: "@#$query@#$"

Instructions:
1. Extract the author name if mentioned (e.g., "by Alice Zhang", "from John Doe")
2. Extract relevant tags/topics (e.g., "about machine learning", "tagged with LLMs")
3. Extract date information:
   - "last year" = @#$last_year@#$
   - "this year" = @#$this_year@#$
   - "June 2023" = year: 2023, month: 6
   - Handle relative dates based on current date
4. Provide confidence score (0-1) for the extraction quality

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "author": "extracted author name or null",
    "tags": ["list", "of", "extracted", "tags"],
    "date_info": {{"year": YYYY, "month": MM, "day": DD}} or null,
    "confidence": 0.XX
}}

Examples:
Query: "Show me articles by Alice Zhang from last year about machine learning"
Response: {{"author": "Alice Zhang", "tags": ["machine learning"], "date_info": {{"year": {self.current_year - 1}}}, "confidence": 0.95}}

Query: "Find posts tagged with 'LLMs' published in June, 2023"
Response: {{"author": null, "tags": ["LLMs"], "date_info": {{"year": 2023, "month": 6}}, "confidence": 0.92}}

Now parse this query and return only the JSON response:
