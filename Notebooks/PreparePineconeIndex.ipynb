Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.advertisementOn the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling display\\n\\n\\nDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game’s hero Vaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duck by Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi’s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn’t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.advertisementAfter Rana’s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai’s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.advertisementAt the other end, Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 balls as the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn’t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn’t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai’s innings.advertisementMeanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated on IPL 2025 with India Today!\",\n",

Gill suffered back spasm during the team's previous match vs Rajasthan Royals. Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementShubman Gill trains before match vs SRH. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 1, 2025 22:30 ISTIn ShortGujarat face Hyderabad in their 10th match of IPL 2025GT have performed strongly this seasonGill suffered a back spasm vs RRGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is likely to play against SunRisers Hyderabad despite suffering a back issue in the last game. Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.advertisementGujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH. GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game, with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.“His fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We’re just trying to be careful with it. He\\'ll be at training today. We\\'ll just see where he\\'s at. We\\'re reasonably confident that he\\'s going to be OK,” said Solanki on the eve of GT’s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi’s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.“Firstly, I don\\'t think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn\\'t take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,” he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.“Of course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,” he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.“We must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team.

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. | RR vs MI Scorecard |advertisementThe teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs. However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back. advertisementVaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday, Dravid had spoken about the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days. Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.

He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13. Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India’s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: May 1, 2025\\nIN THIS STORY#IPL 2025Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchAir India flight to US grounded in Vienna due to extended maintenanceBJP leader, singer Hans Raj backs Diljit Dosanjh, says Pakistani actors not at faultIndia-US interim trade deal likely within 48 hoursPM Modi conferred with Ghana's highest civilian honour for global leadershipAmarnath Yatra begins as thousands embark on pilgrimage amid tight securityAdvertisementRead ThisIIM Raipur concludes 8-day Bootcamp for incoming batchOppo Pad SE launched, brings big screen and 9340mAh battery for Rs 13,999Sensex settles 170 points lower, Nifty below 25,500; Maruti down 1%Your Apple Watch will soon alert you when its battery is running out faster than usualBrown and white rice differences: nutrition and health benefitsAdvertisement      \\n\\n\\n\\n  Follow Us On:                      AdvertisementPUBLICATIONSIndia TodayBusiness TodayIndia Today-HindiTIME TELEVISIONIndia Today TVAaj Tak Good News TodayEVENTSAgenda AajTakIndia Today ConclaveSahitya AajTak RADIOIshq FMAajTak RadioGAMINGIndia Today Gaming World Esports CupUSEFUL LINKSPress ReleaseSitemapNewsNewsletter Privacy PolicyCorrection PolicyLMIL DocumentsPRINTINGThomson PressWELFARECare TodayDISTRIBUTIONRate Card    SYNDICATIONS  Headlines Today        WEBSITES  India Today India Today Malayalam India Today NE Business Today DailyO AajTak Lallantop Bangla GNTTV iChowk Reader’s Digest Cosmopolitan    EDUCATION  Vasant Valley Best Colleges Best Universities          Download App              ABOUT US CONTACT US TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARCHIVES    Copyright © 2025 Living Media India Limited.

Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementVaibhav Suryavanshi became the talk of the cricket world after his 35-ball hundred in IPL 2025 (AP Photo)India Today Sports DeskNEw DElhi,UPDATED: May 1, 2025 20:38 ISTIn ShortSunil Gavaskar warns against overpraising young Vaibhav SuryavanshiVaibhav scored a 35-ball century in IPL against Gujarat TitansHe is the youngest to score a century in Twenty20 cricketBatting great Sunil Gavaskar has said it is important not to praise Vaibhav Suryavanshi to the skies and heap pressure on the 14-year-old following his Indian Premier League (IPL) heroics against Gujarat Titans. Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.advertisementVaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indian in the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav\\'s childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in, said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debut for India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar. \"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look — when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he’s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings — he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn’t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, ‘Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?’ They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he’s facing today — literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spoke about how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don’t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It\\'s part of becoming a cricketer in India — you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished By: Akshay RameshPublished On: May 1, 2025You May Also Like\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchShashi Tharoor criticises Indira Gandhi\\'s emergency, calls it erosion of freedomEarthquake of 4.4 magnitude jolts Delhi-NCR, epicentre in Haryana\\'s JhajjarTo be Chief Minister for 5 years: Siddaramiah on Karnataka leadership shuffle rowVijay Deverakonda, Rana Daggubati among 29 celebrities in ED\\'s betting app caseArvind Kejriwal says he deserves Nobel prize for governance and administrationAdvertisementRead ThisA young officer, a new father: Story of 2 IAF pilots killed in Rajasthan crashNo link between spike in heart attacks, Covid vaccine, probe reveals after Siddaramaiah\\'s claimDharmendra Pradhan opens VCs’ meet to review NEP 2020 implementationCoimbatore blast accused held in Karnataka after 29 years on the runEdgbaston effect?

The players from India’s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwan instead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.advertisement\"I was the captain who didn’t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn’t even on the auction table. We already had — I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan — we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn’t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let’s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice — Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,” Sehwag said on Cricbuzz. Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season as he scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi’s run to the semi-final. Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated on IPL 2025 with India Today!

On Wednesday, April 30, the Tigers hammered the visitors by an innings and 106 runs at the Bir Sreshtho Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium in Chattogram.Mehidy Hasan Miraz picked up a five-wicket and also scored 104 as Bangladesh finished the two-match series 1-1. Shadman Islam and Taijul Islam also scored a hundred and took a six-wicket haul respectively. But Shanto said that the home team missed out on a golden chance of winning the series.advertisement\"I\\'m not really happy. If you look at the whole series, we should have played better cricket. We didn\\'t perform well in the first Test. Although we made a comeback, this is a series we should have won,” Shanto told the reporters after the match. Bangladesh lost the opening Test in Sylhet by three wickets in Sylhet before making a comeback in Chattogram. Shanto said that his team’s batters need to learn how to convert starts into big scores.\"We played poor cricket in the first Test so it was important to bounce back. We won in Pakistan and the West Indies earlier and that means we have that ability. We just need to play according to our potential,” Shanto said.\"As a captain, I don\\'t want this kind of scoreboard. If Shadman could score 200, I could hit a 100, or Mushfiqur Rahim scored 150, I would be happier, rather than everyone scoring 40s. Losing a wicket after getting set is not a good sign, as this can\\'t enhance our confidence. In Sri Lanka, whoever gets set, should score 150-200,\" Shanto added.Shanto had a decent series with the bat in hand after he scored 123 runs from three innings at an average of 41 with a top score of 60.- EndsPublished By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: May 1, 2025Also Read |  Rohit Sharma reveals chat with his parents after Wankhede stadium honour\\nWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchShashi Tharoor criticises Indira Gandhi\\'s emergency, calls it erosion of freedomEarthquake of 4.4 magnitude jolts Delhi-NCR, epicentre in Haryana\\'s JhajjarTo be Chief Minister for 5 years: Siddaramiah on Karnataka leadership shuffle rowVijay Deverakonda, Rana Daggubati among 29 celebrities in ED\\'s betting app caseArvind Kejriwal says he deserves Nobel prize for governance and administrationAdvertisementRead ThisTata extends lifetime battery warranty to Curvv.ev, Nexon.ev 45kWh battery packSatisfied with police investigation, Kolkata law college rape survivor tells courtHow Rajamouli took a colloquial term as title and made a pan India blockbusterRaj Nidimoru\\'s wife shares golden rules of life after Samantha\\'s new pics with himGoogle announces free AI Pro with Veo 3 access for Pixel 9 Pro users in IndiaAdvertisement      \\n\\n\\n\\n  Follow Us On:                      AdvertisementPUBLICATIONSIndia TodayBusiness TodayIndia Today-HindiTIME TELEVISIONIndia Today TVAaj Tak Good News TodayEVENTSAgenda AajTakIndia Today ConclaveSahitya AajTak RADIOIshq FMAajTak RadioGAMINGIndia Today Gaming World Esports CupUSEFUL LINKSPress ReleaseSitemapNewsNewsletter Privacy PolicyCorrection PolicyLMIL DocumentsPRINTINGThomson PressWELFARECare TodayDISTRIBUTIONRate Card    SYNDICATIONS  Headlines Today        WEBSITES  India Today India Today Malayalam India Today NE Business Today DailyO AajTak Lallantop Bangla GNTTV iChowk Reader’s Digest Cosmopolitan    EDUCATION  Vasant Valley Best Colleges Best Universities          Download App              ABOUT US CONTACT US TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARCHIVES    Copyright © 2025 Living Media India Limited.

I was told that I should play after three or four matches because my surgery was quite major. “But James took such good care of me, better than anyone else could. I’m really thankful that I came to this franchise — I became completely fit. Otherwise, I have been dealing with this issue for the past two years.
